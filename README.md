# Planting-Algorithm-demo
I wrote these codes after reading the eassy of Leonardo Uieda about planting algorithm devoting to estimate anomalous density distributation undersurface.
I am interested in this algorithm beacuse of its elegant thinking of inversing geophysics data without solving a linear system. So I tried to learn more details and wrote these codes. Also I can practice for programming during this process.
But these codes are far from perfect beacuse of my limtiting ability. I'd like to update the codes by the improving of my skills.
This is the first time for me to use github, if I do something insuitable, please teach me how to do the right. If you have any suggestion to the codes, I look forward to a futher communication.
